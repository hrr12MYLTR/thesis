## Create, share, and browse spots that are happening near you now! ##

## Summary ##
  irl encourages you to participate more in the world around you by providing a time-limited, ultra-local index of fun and novel events. At a glance, you can locate interesting things to see and do in your immediate environment.

## The Problem ##
  Technology can encourage us to be passive, anonymous observers who become isolated from the world around us. Too often, we confine ourselves to a self-reinforcing information bubble by visiting the same websites and physical locations each day.

## The Solution ##
  irl provides a tool that encourages participation and immediacy by showing you what's happening now in your area. You can create spots for your own events, share them publicly or privately, and browse the spots around you to join in and have more interesting life experiences.

## How to Get Started ##
  To see what's out there, just start browsing the map!

  You can filter by spot category (food, entertainment, etc.) right on the map. You can also search for a particular spot or user.

  To create and share a spot, click or tap the plus button in the upper-right corner of the screen.

  Choose a category and fill in the details. Then you can share the spot via Twitter, Facebook, Google+, email, or SMS message.
